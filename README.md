# Titanic Survival Rate
**Data Science  
Titanic Survival Prediction**
This project aims to predict survival outcomes for passengers on the Titanic using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers such as age, sex, class, and more.

**Algorithms Used**
**Linear Regression**: A statistical method used to model and analyze the relationships between the dependent and independent variables. For this dataset, the linear regression model yielded a prediction accuracy of 19%.

**Logistic Regression**: A classification algorithm used to model binary outcomes. In this case, it predicted survival probability with an accuracy of 75%.

**Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance. This model achieved an accuracy of 95%.

**Data Preprocessing**
Before applying the machine learning models, the dataset underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure the quality and accuracy of the results:

**Data Cleaning:**

Removed irrelevant or duplicate records.
Handled missing values through imputation.
Feature Engineering:

Created new features from existing data where applicable.
Encoded categorical variables into numerical format.
**Outlier Removal**:

Identified and removed outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to improve model performance.
**Data Visualization:**

Utilized Box Plots to visualize distributions and detect outliers.
Created Heat Maps to explore correlations between features and identify potential patterns.
Results
**Linear Regression:** 19% accuracy
**Logistic Regression**:  75% accuracy
**Random Forest:** 95% accuracy
